#### *Delicious to consume anytime of the year!*

**Ingredients:**

-   1.25 cups unsalted butter
-   1.25 cups light brown sugar
-   1 cup granulated sugar
-   2 large eggs
-   2 teaspoons vanilla extract
-   1.25 teaspoons baking soda
-   1.5 teaspoons baking powder
-   1.5 teaspoons kosher salt
-   3.5 cups all-purpose flour
-   1.25 pounds bittersweet chocolate disks

**Kitchen Tools**

-   Stand mixer
-   Baking Sheets
-   Parchment paper
-   Mixing Bowl
-   Oven

**Steps**

1.  Cream the butter and sugars together with the mixer (or by hand) until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes.
2.  Add eggs, one at a time, and mix to combine.
3.  Add vanilla, mix, then scrape down bowl.
4.  Sprinkle baking soda, baking powder, and salt over dough and mix it until fully combined.
5.  Add flour all at once and mix in short bursts until it almost completely disappears, but no longer.
6.  Add chocolate pieces in and try to incorporate them without breaking them.
7.  Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill in fridge for a minimum of 24 hours and up to 72 hours.
8.  Heat oven to 350 degrees and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
9.  Form dough into 3.5 ounce balls and arrange *very* far apart on sheets and sprinkle the tops with a few flecks of sea salt.
10. Bake cookies for 12 to 17 minutes until golden all over.
11. Cool cookies for 10 miniutes then transfer them to racks.

3. Euclidean Distance
=====================

#### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them **$(\\overline{\\textbf{pq}})$**.
In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, …, *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, …, *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then
the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as
Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at
the two points. The [Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of
the vector:
where the last expresssion involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
